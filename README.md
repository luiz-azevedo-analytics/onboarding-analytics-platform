# onboarding-analytics-platform
Scalable onboarding analytics framework using SQL, dbt, and BI tools.

## Business Context
This project demonstrates how to design a scalable onboarding analytics framework for a high-growth B2B SaaS company. The goal is to bring structure and clarity to onboarding data, enabling teams to identify bottlenecks, improve activation, and scale operations through data-driven decisions.

## Tech Stack
- SQL
- dbt
- BigQuery
- BI Tool (Looker-style semantic modeling)
- Git & GitHub

## Project Status
🚧 In progress — foundational data models and onboarding metrics under development.

## Onboarding Flow
This project models a simplified but realistic B2B SaaS onboarding journey:

1. Company account created
2. Admin user created
3. Team members invited
4. Payroll information submitted
5. Compliance documents uploaded
6. First employee paid
7. Onboarding completed

Each step is tracked as an event, allowing analysis of drop-offs, time-to-value, and operational bottlenecks.
